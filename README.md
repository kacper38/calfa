reconstruction of ss structure give alpha carbon coordinates

Prediction of secondary structure given only alpha carbons coordinates, 
Coordinates saved in PCA format
Secondary structure verification done using DSSP

Prediction based on neural network


currently trying different types of file formats to feed into the network
